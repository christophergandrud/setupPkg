Description: When working across multiple machines and, similarly for
    reproducible research, it can be time consuming to ensure that you have
    all of the needed packages installed and loaded. setupPkg provides one
    simple function that checks if needed packages are installed, installs them
    if missing, and then loads all of the requested packages. Include at the
    top of all your R source code files to make sure that all packages needed to
    run a script are installed and loaded.
